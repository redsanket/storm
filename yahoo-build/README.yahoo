This package is a wrapper around the open source storm package.

It is intended to provide a simple way to run a storm grid.  The storm.yaml 
config file is modified through yinst settings.  Any yinst setting on the 
ystorm package will be translated into entires in storm.yaml replacing 
'_' characters with '.' characters.

For example

yinst set ystorm.nimbus_host host.corp.yahoo.com

whould add the following line to storm.yaml

nimbus.host: host.corp.yahoo.com

If you want to override JAVA_HOME for storm consistently set ystorm.JAVA_HOME
and storm will use it in place of JAVA_HOME set in the regular environment.

NOTE ABOUT SUPPORT:
-------------------
The ystorm yinst packages, ystorm and
ystorm_{nimbus,drpc,supervisor,ui,logviewer,registry}, are intended primarily
to be used by the storm team itself for running a hosted storm service inside
of Yahoo, and as a maven dependency for teams that want to compile storm
topologies that run on this hosted service.  If you want to use ystorm for
testing your code using ystorm_onabox, that is fine, but we do not officially
support those setups.  We are generally nice people and if you are in a bind we
can help even for production issues on most versions of storm, but we cannot
guarantee anything.  If you do want our help debugging please make sure that we
have access to the boxes that your storm cluster is running on.  We do not like
debugging issues over webex, it just isn't an efficient use of our time. The
Storm team is on the insider list and has been trained with PII so it should
hopefully not be an issue with the Paranoids.

Be aware that by default the ystorm packages are NOT secure. This is to help
facilitate testing, but please do NOT run any financial or PII data through a
cluster you setup yourself.  The paranoids would not like it.  If you want
information about how to secure your own clusters please look at
http://twiki.corp.yahoo.com/view/Grid/MultiTenantStormSetup and
http://twiki.corp.yahoo.com/view/Grid/StormRegistryService.  But just like with
other clusters we do NOT officially support these setups and do not guarantee
that we will announce when we push new security fixes, or be willing to back
port them to older releases.

Is a best practice to keep all configurations the same for all storm cluster
nodes (gateways, nimbus, supervisors).  If you run into trouble, check your
configurations against those of a hosted storm cluster.
